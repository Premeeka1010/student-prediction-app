 This Repository holds documentation for a College project made by a group of Students from Patan Multiple Campus. Project aims to help students in determining what they need to work on in order to get good grades and perform well in their exams without stressing over doing everything all at once as much as they can (this can harm their mental state).

## Information about this project has been divided into the following parts:

1. Problem Statement
2. Data Collection
3. Model Training Plan
4. How our project can help students (Use cases)
5. Team members
